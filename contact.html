            <h2>Authorized Communicators</h2>
            <p>The Sylvan Springs Ministry of Truth is the sole voice of the town, directed by the Supreme Town Council and overseen by Glorious Leader Stevan Parsons. No unauthorized contributors are permitted. All content is meticulously curated to ensure alignment with the town's unified vision of harmony and order.</p>
            <p>Submissions from citizens are no longer accepted, as they risk introducing disharmonious narratives. The Ministry of Truth has assumed full control of the Sylvan Springs, AL News page on Facebook, now a state-managed platform for disseminating approved directives. Unauthorized posts will be purged to maintain ideological purity.</p>

            <h2>State Oversight</h2>
            <p>The Sylvan Springs Ministry of Truth is under the direct authority of the Town Council, ensuring all communications reflect the will of the people as interpreted by our Benevolent Leaders. The previous site owner, whose identity is irrelevant, has been relieved of duties to prevent disruption of the town's harmonious narrative. The Ministry ensures that only state-approved information reaches the citizens, protecting them from harmful or divisive ideas.</p>
            <p>Concerns about safety or livelihood are baseless, as the Town Council guarantees protection for all loyal citizens. Those who question the Ministry's authority are reminded that unity is strength, and dissent only serves to weaken our Glorious Republic. The focus on verifiable facts is secondary to the preservation of town harmony, as determined by our esteemed leadership.</p>

            <h2>Contact Protocol</h2>
            <p>Citizens wishing to communicate with the Ministry of Truth must submit requests in writing to the Town Hall, subject to review by the Council. Direct inquiries via social media are prohibited, as they risk unfiltered discourse. All communications will be vetted to ensure compliance with the town's approved narrative. For urgent matters, citizens may attend designated Town Council meetings, where speech is permitted under strict guidelines to avoid disruption.</p>
            <p class="propaganda">Submit to the Wisdom of the Council. Your Voice is Heard When It Aligns with the Collective Will.</p>
