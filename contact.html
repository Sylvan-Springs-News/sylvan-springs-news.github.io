      <h2>About the Authors</h2>
      <h3>Open Interest Contributors Accepted.</h3>
      <p>There are multiple contributors creating articles. Sometimes, a candidate for election might contribute, and those will be marked accordingly. It may even be an outside contributor from a nearby community. The idea is to increase knowledge of Sylvan Springs news, events, and history.</p>
      <p>This website has articles submitteed primarily by residents of Sylvan Springs. To submit ideas for articles, join the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61578895954032" target=_blank><b>Sylvan Springs, AL News</b></a> page on Facebook, send a message.</p>
      <h3>Ownership</h3>
      <p>The owner of this site has been a resident of Sylvan Springs for the past 5 years, engages and discusses events/governance, as we all should. During these 5 years, the owner has championed for Sylvan Springs. Unfortunately, the behavior of some residents has caused reason to fear safety and livelihood. Those who know the owner of the site and what he is about will know. <br/><br/>To some, <b>who</b> published an article is more important than the verifiable facts, because there is no opportunity to bring harm to the messenger. That needs to change, and it is a shame that it has come to this, among supposed churched people.
      <ul>
        <b>Background:</b>
        <li>Jefferson County, AL resident from birth until 2008. Moved to Springfield, MO to start a Hewlett Packard Call Center, for their CEO Escalations group.</li>
        <li>Lived through the April 27, 2011 tornado in Pleasant Grove, direct hit, as well as the May 22, 2011 Joplin, MO tornado.</li>
        <li>Moved from McCalla/Bessemer to Sylvan Springs, and have been a resident for over 5 years.</li>
        <li>No criminal record, Christian, zero drugs or alcohol, unlike Congress. I like being alive, fixing and building things.</li>
        <li>Graduated from Pleasant Grove High School with Advanced Academic Endorsement, dropped out from Bevill State Community College, Certified Google Data Analyst, MongoDB Certified DBA, employed as a SQL Server DBA (jack of all trades of infrastructure). I’m still working on IBM mainframe practicioner certificates w/focus on DB2.</li>
        <b>Idea System:</b>
        <li>Liberty minded, conservative thinking, liberally accepting, balanced around common sense. The Constitution restricts government. Constitutional believer with a strong sense of justice, right and wrong. Not afraid of stepping across political party lines when it is objectively right. <em>Are we really a two party system, or is it one dysfunctional elite uniparty, protecting the machine? Proof is in the pudding.</em></li>
        <li>Look below the surface, beware of misuse of faith and churchy jargon. There are many leaders in history who used churchy language/powers to do terrible things to people, which was not truly in alignment with Biblical teachings. It was a tool, to some people. We still see that today. Beware, and be educated of what is actually in there - not the trail mix version. Accept the pretzels.</li>
        <b>Activities/Achievements:</b>
        <li>2020 Promoted and lobbied AT&T for fiber internet for our community, which began the planning stages around 2023 (per Alabama 811 public data), and is coming soon to your Sylvan Springs neighborhood.</li>
        <li>Looking out the safety of neighbors, when crime comes from outside of Sylvan Springs. PG Police chased a white Ford F-150 to our street. Raised concerns about dumping unwanted dogs in random places in Sylvan Springs, addressing animal control/leash law/irresponsible owner situations.</li>
        <li>Support for law enforcement, a necessary and difficult job - particularly the ones who do right by the Constitution. (It isn't unconditional. Requires true commitment to honor the spirit of our nation's laws and values, even when superiors/receiving a paycheck is at odds with what's right.)</li>
        <li>Participated with ALERT/NWS at National Night Out in Sylvan Springs, volunteered at NWS for more than 13 years at the forecast office (ALERT/Skywarn), rebuilding Skywarn's communication presence for Central Alabama (BMXSpotterChat).</li>
        <li>Technology/information security literacy, defeating the scammers one pun at a time.</li>
