      <h2>Rumor Mill: What happens if an elected mayor steps down?</h2>
      <h3>Discussion of concerns of mayoral continuity.</h3>
      <h5>Original Story: July 30, 2025<br/>
      <!--Updated with Followup: July 30, 2025--></h5>
    <h2>Background: The Election Shock</h2>
    <p>The Town of Sylvan Springs is currently in its first election season in 20 years, to have two candidates for mayor in the race, which shocked many citizens. Reactions were mixed, between "FINALLY, our town can get those potholes and roads fixed" and "Ah crap, there goes our small town." In social media such as "What's Happening in Sylvan Springs?", there had been some spirited discussion regarding both candidates, and who would be a better mayor, wild rumors abound about both candidates. Sylvan Springs local social media shows a divided community, often with discussions degenerating with no real facts from the candidates or reliable sources. Only speculation.</p>
    <p>To assist citizens with making an educated decision, I decided to interview both candidates in a neutral fashion, and allow them to review, send edits/approve of, the final result that was released, so as to ensure that there were no misunderstandings or misstatements of what was said in the interview. When I interviewed both candidates, I saw the need to dig deeper into stories impacting Sylvan Springs, and potentially the election.</p>

    <h3>Social Media Rumors</h3>
    <p>There was a rumor that was going around, born out of our mayor's current age, saying that Stevan Parsons didn't plan on being a full-term mayor, but was going to get through the election and then hand it off to someone on the council, by appointment if elected. Names like Rickey Jones came up in passing. On the other side of that, there was a post on social media which now we couldn't find a second time, saying that this was not Stev's plan, and that Stev planned on this being a full-term mayor situation.</p>
    
    <h3>What is really the case?</h3>
    <p>Deepening the investigation, at town hall, Matt Kinder was asked about this, and his answer aligned with the State of Alabama. In short, Alabama's law states that there would be a temporary appointment of the Mayor Pro Tem or Council President, for up to 60 to 90 days, requiring a special election if there is more than a year remaining in a mayor's term.<br/><br/>
      However, that didn't seem cut-and-dry, because we are a town of under 12,000. See this link, to the <a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/alabama/title-11/title-2/chapter-43/article-3/section-11-43-42/">Code of Alabama</a>. <u>It wasn't clear, if Sylvan Springs would be legally forced to have a special election, by our reading of the statute.</u></p>

    <h3>Who would be mayor if Stev is elected and steps down?</h3>
    <p>What was surprising, was I didn't know that Rickey Jones was the Council President/Mayor Pro Tem, until today, which makes me question how much truth there was to the rumor. It would be him if he accepted the position.</p>

    <p>At the end of the day, only God can truly know a man's heart. I pray that there is no truth to the rumor that I heard, but I find only small comfort that the State of Alabama does have something to say about how municipal governments go about this.<br/><br/>
    <b>The question is, will the citizens of Sylvan Springs happily accept not having a vote on their town's future, if even for under a year? Would there be anyone willing to run for mayor if this comes to pass? Has there been an effort to stop the election that we don't know about?</b></p>
    <h3>Opinion</h3>
    <p>I want Sylvan Springs to be there for my son when he is my age. Intact, including his rights as a citizen to speak, to vote, to be informed, to be a part of the citizen press, and even to criticize officials when they do wrong. Accountability is, like it or not, a required part of the Christian walk, and of being a government official. Let's preserve our country, one small town, one vote at a time.</p>
