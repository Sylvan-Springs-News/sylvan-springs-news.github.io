        <h2>Actual Facts (Hidden in the Shadows)</h2>
        <p>The dystopian reality: Sylvan Springs shut off comments on their government-owned Facebook page to prevent talk about the election, stifling free speech in the name of "order."</p>
        <p>This action raises serious First Amendment concerns, as it may constitute impermissible viewpoint discrimination and content-based restrictions on public forums. Relevant case law includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lindke v. Freed, 601 U.S. 187 (2024)</strong>: The Supreme Court established a test for determining when a public official's social media activity constitutes state action, potentially making blocking or restricting access a First Amendment violation if done in an official capacity.<grok-card data-id="60fde9" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card><grok-card data-id="cf11fd" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card></li>
            <li><strong>O’Connor-Ratcliff v. Garnier, 601 U.S. 205 (2024)</strong>: Companion case to Lindke, emphasizing that officials cannot block critics from social media pages used for official purposes without violating free speech rights.<grok-card data-id="e38dec" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card></li>
            <li><strong>Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University v. Trump, 928 F.3d 226 (2d Cir. 2019)</strong>: Held that blocking users from a government official's social media account based on their viewpoints violates the First Amendment, as the interactive space constitutes a public forum.<grok-card data-id="d1b012" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card></li>
            <li><strong>Davison v. Randall, 912 F.3d 666 (4th Cir. 2019)</strong>: Banning a user from a government official's Facebook page for critical comments was ruled unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination.<grok-card data-id="ce4eae" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card></li>
        </ul>
        <p>While shutting off all comments might seem content-neutral, doing so specifically to suppress election-related discussions can be seen as a pretext for viewpoint discrimination, barred under these precedents. Governments cannot close public forums merely to avoid disfavored speech.</p>
