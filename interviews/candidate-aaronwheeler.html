    <h3>Interviewer Transparency</h3>

    <p><em>This article is not a 100% direct quote of the candidate, but written based on an understanding of the notes taken during the interview. The author is unaffiliated with Aaron Wheeler, the campaign, not compensated in any way, and this is the first time meeting one-on-one with Mr. Wheeler.<br/><br/>
    This article was presented to Aaron Wheeler prior to publishing, to ensure that nothing was misunderstood or misstated. Both this candiate and the competitor's interview were published on the exact same date and time. The interview template used for both candidates was the same, except for specific questions related only to the candidate/online concerns that we have seen posted. The competitors were not allowed to view the other's interview content prior to publication. We may publish a separate follow-up.<br/><br/>The opinions expressed are not necessarily the opinions of the author, site owner, affiliates/employers, for the purpose of this article.</p>

    <h2>Candidate's Opening Thoughts on Issues/Concerns</h2>
    <p><b>"In a nutshell, continue Stev's direction and have positive momentum for Sylvan Springs."</b><br/>
    
    In an interview, Aaron Wheeler expressed respect for Stev and a desire to maintain a positive relationship, noting no direct issues with him.</p>
    <p>Aaron was encouraged to run for mayor by his community 6-8 months ago. He aims to address local issues like the Sunset drop-off, where exposed utilities and erosion threaten road integrity. He expressed that his Christian faith plays an important role in being willing and obedient to serve Sylvan Springs and everyone in it properly.</p>
    <p>Aaron plans to build on Stev's vision with a positive, forward-thinking approach, more momentum on initiatives, focusing on uniting the community and preserving its small-town culture long-term.</p>

    <h2>Foundational Beliefs</h2>
  <h3>Q1 - Why are you running for mayor?</h3>
    <p>Aaron was repeatedly encouraged by neighbors and community members to run, initially dismissing the idea but later feeling compelled to serve.</p>
    <h3>Q2 - What are your beliefs about the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights? Should citizens ever have to trade one Constitutional right for another?</h3>
    <p>Aaron's response, quoted: "I believe they work hand in hand and they should not be used against each other." "My short answer is a strong no. They don’t contradict each other in my humble opinion."</p>
    <h3>Q3 - Can you name the five freedoms guaranteed by the first amendment?</h3>
    <p>Interviewer Notes: Aaron got 4/5, only missing assembly - not bad! Please note: These are easy to miss/forget as an average citizen, and many officers who swore an oath to the Constitution can't answer this question on-the-spot. The answers are Religion, Speech, Press, Assembly, Petition.</p>
    <p>For our readers, here's an accurate AI-generated definition, boiling it down:
      <ul>
        <li>Religion - This component protects the right to practice any religion or no religion at all. It prevents the government from establishing an official religion and guarantees the free exercise of religion.</li>
        <li>Speech - This right ensures that individuals can express their thoughts and opinions without government interference. It allows for public debate, criticism of the government, and advocacy for change.</li>
        <li>Press - This right safeguards the independence of the media, allowing journalists to report on government activities without fear of retaliation. It plays a crucial role in holding those in power accountable. The citizens are the press, corporation not required.</li>
        <li>Assembly - This freedom allows individuals to gather in public spaces to express their views, protest injustices, and advocate for change. It ensures that citizens can come together to voice their concerns.</li>
        <li>Petition - This right enables individuals to address grievances to the government and seek redress for issues that affect them. It empowers citizens to hold elected officials accountable and advocate for policies that align with their beliefs.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Q4 - Have you made a records request in Sylvan Springs?</h3>
    <p>Yes, for financial data. Aaron supports transparency, stating, "What do we have to hide?"</p>
    <p><em>Interviewer Note:</em> Public records, like fire department call data, can highlight issues (e.g., illegal burning) or inform prevention efforts. Data analysis should aim for unbiased, actionable insights, unlike potentially biased traditional media. Data Analysis as a practice is about providing high quality actionable insights based on what the data tells you, not making the data tell you what you want it to say.</p>
   <h3>Q5 - Should town-owned social media allow free speech like in-person forums?</h3>
   <p><em>Interviewer Note:</em> Skipped due to time constraints after a 2-hour interview. Q2 and Q3 responses suggest Aaron’s stance, but we’ll seek an official answer.</p>
    
    <h2>Fiscal Policy</h2>
    <h3>Q1 - Will you be supporting raising taxes to accomplish the goals you have as mayor?</h3>
    <p>Aaron's Response: We have to be careful with this.
      <ul>
        <li>Don't sign contracts that doesn't give a way out.</li>
        <li>No plans of raising taxes, unless there is no other alternative.</li> 
        <li>I'm thinking there are other avenues. In January, Sylvan Springs income was $106K, expenditures were around $50k, the rest goes in the bank. I'm hoping to get a more detailed, longer term report to review. I need this information to better answer on financials, because larger expenditures probably occur at different parts of the year.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Local Issues</h2>
    <h3>Q1 - Fire Department Governance: Do you support the fire department's current autonomy in its operations?</h3>
    <p>I need to research more on this. My first glance opinion, the chief needs the authority to operate, with oversight from the council.</p>
    <p>Interviewer Note: I believe that is how it is currently done.</p>
    <h3>Q2 - Infrastructure/Roads: We heard pot holes on Sunset Dr was a concern. AL-269 seems to be a state road not getting a lot of care. What is your proposal to fix this ongoing issue?</h3>
    <p>Aaron expressed that it needs to be addressed, as it is a potential safety issue, due to the drop-off into a ravine at that location. He noted that there should be resources to do this kind of repair.</p>

    <h2>Crime and Rental Properties</h2>
    <h3>Q1 - Addiction/mental health issues is a growing concern nationwide, and our town isn't an exception. SSFD runs a few calls a year for this type of thing. What are your thoughts on this issue?</h3>
    <p>Aaron understands and supports getting people referred to needed resources. Difficult to address, and a real thing, with a lot of complexity.</p>
        <p><em>Interviewer Note:</em> Mayoral influence is limited<s>, but closer communities often manage better</s>. The town lacks a police force and cannot feasibly budget for one. Government stigma/national events may also deter those who may seek help.<br/>
    <em>7/29 Interviewer Clarification:</em> We were asked if there was proof of the above statement regarding mayoral influence, regarding Q1 (addiction/mental health issues). What we are trying to convey, is the mayor doesn't have control of this, and lacks the resources to do so. We used AI to try to make our notes brief, and more grammatically correct. Lesson learned, it puts its own ideas in there. In our original interview with Stev, I even glossed over this topic because we recognize limitations of what government officials can feasibly do. It takes a community to combat the epidemic. Stev's article will be noted as well.</p>
    <h3>Q2 - Some residents are concerned about crime, from individuals from outside our town. There was previous talk of rental property restrictions or fees in Sylvan Springs Council Meetings, noting that this could be a discrimination concern. How would new restrictions on rental properties reduce crime?</h3>
    <p>Aaron clarified, that his mention of rentals wasn't focused on the crime aspect. Aaron wants to preserve community cohesion, not just reduce crime. Short-term rentals may weaken neighborhood bonds, impacting appearance and stability. Nearby towns requires rental companies to pay fees, but investment-driven sales and Section 8 rentals can disrupt neighborhoods. Poor school performance also drives families away, reducing community appeal.</p>
    <p>"The issue is, houses are going up for sale <i>as a trend</i>, and that changes entire neighborhoods as families move out, the investment company picks it up, gets rent, and potentially Section 8. This tends to impact the area."</p>
    <p>One of the concerns of why younger/parenting aged adults may want to move away, or why Sylvan Springs wouldn't be the first choice is the schools that we are zoned for, and their poor performance. If people are willing to do it, we could potentially work together to create a private but local home schooling cover school group. One of the downfalls of homeschool is socializing with others, and this helps with that. Possibly, build the community along with that with a once a month get-together event, so that people meet, network, and know each other again.</p>
    <h3>Q3 - Will you impose new restrictions on landowners’ property use?</h3>
    <p>No plans so far. Aaron raised the importance of consistency/sensibility in enforcement, not picking and choosing, but also noted challenges without police support.Example: The leash law/dog-at-large situation.</p>
    <p>I<em>Interviewer Note:</em> Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office reportedly doesn’t enforce town ordinances. Not a directly mayoral issue, but a concern. Dog-related issues, including attacks and abandonment, have persisted, with recent regional dog mauling deaths raising concerns. Of note, Jefferson County Animal Control has been inconsistent in servicing the Sylvan Springs area at times.<br/>
      <b>History of dog-related issues:</b> Over the past 5 years, there had been a newsletter or two that brought up the leash law, or dogs at-large. Near Julians/Old Southern Hardware, and the streets behind, there have been a few situations of dogs at large or abandoned. In 2020, we adopted a dog that a breeder had dumped in the neighborhood. There have been chickens lost to dogs. There was also a dog attack in the neighborhood, which didn't make the news. Owner of that dog was not held accountable. In 2023-2024, there were two dogs dumped by individuals that lived on another road in Sylvan Springs, and the dogs were not only food aggressive, but tried to attack the wife - who jumped the fence to avoid them. Imagine if this had been a child. Another news story. This month, July 2025, someone dumped a pit bull in the area. This pit bull, so far as we know, hasn't attacked, <em>but this trend is a concern</em>, in light of two deaths from maulings in Bessemer, AL in the news <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2025/07/woman-found-dead-in-grassy-lot-in-bessemer-was-fatally-mauled-by-dogs.html">on al.com</a>, and a second attack, which was covered by <a href="https://www.wvtm13.com/article/second-deadly-dog-attack-in-3-days-in-central-alabama/65514215">WVTM/Channel 13 News</a>.</p>
      <h2>Economic Development</h2>
      <h3>Q1 - How will you attract businesses to Sylvan Springs?</h3>
      <p>Aaron sees this as challenging, prioritizing community-building to drive local business demand. "This is not an easy fix. We need businesses for city revenue, but we also need a local to go into that shop and do business."</p>
      <p><em>Interviewer Note: Aaron does not support chain fast food restaurants for Sylvan Springs, and would prefer local ownership.</em></p>
      <p><em>Interviewer Note, regarding discussions in Facebooks:</em> To illustrate the considerations of running a business, we will use a fast-food restaurant (like Jack's) as an example. <br />
        Sylvan Springs population in 2023 was 1559, with 57% being over 18 (889) (Source: <a href="https://censusreporter.org/profiles/16000US0174424-sylvan-springs-al/">CensusReporter.org</a>). A typical fast food restaurant requires an average of 200-300 customers daily in order to cover its costs (Source: <a href="https://dojobusiness.com/blogs/news/fast-food-restaurant-daily-customers">BusinessDojo</a>). <em><b>This means at least 22%, or 1 in 4 adult Sylvan Springs residents would have to choose to eat fast food daily, for a fast-food business to survive. That doesn't sound healthy or sustainable.</b></em> In closing, new businesses will need to have an understanding of their market area, and how to turn a profit with a good flow of business to survive.</p>
      <h3>Q2 - How will you address underperforming schools that Sylvan Springs is zoned for?</h3>
      <p>Aaron supports homeschooling, drawing from personal experience with his children, but acknowledges its demands. Poor schools drive families away, increasing home sales and rentals. He suggests a local homeschool group to foster socialization and community events to build cohesion.<br />
        
       "It's difficult to fix public schools, but what do we do?" A poorly performing school for a community creates people moving, and once again too many homes for sale. <br />
       Aaron mentioned, when he was a kid, if you wanted to buy in Sylvan Springs, you had to look for months. Neighborhoods were so tight-knit, someone knew someone, when a home was purchased. That's how a community remains kept up.<br />
      With rentals, someone has got to be concerned about what opportunities are around for kids.<br />
      Home schooling has pros/cons, and you have to have willing teachers (often a stay at home parent), to sacrifice the time at least until highschool age. Parents have to be committed for home school to work.<br />
      There are a lot of people home schooling in Sylvan Springs. Good people around our age do not want their child in public schools if they don't have to. Aaron says, "The younger generations are moving away because of the school system." That's not a reflection on our council or mayor by any means.</p>
      <h2>Community Events</h2>
      <h3>Q1 - What community events do you propose?</h3>
      <p>Aaron wants to gather ideas for periodic events to strengthen community ties.</p>
      <p><em>Interviewer Note:</em> Events like block parties could boost local vendors, food trucks, and community engagement, fostering better resilience for crises like disaster response coordination, or for coming together to have a memorable town event.</p>
      <h2>Campaign Visibility and Transparency</h2>
      <h3>Aaron-Only Question: Why haven’t you been visible at council meetings?</h3>
      <p>Aaron attended some meetings but limited appearances to respect the current mayor, Stev, aiming for a positive campaign. He invites residents to a meet-and-greet on August 2, 11a-2p, at the Community Center.<br /> 
      One of Aaron's election goals is not just to be elected, but to run a positive campaign, and still be able to shake hands and have a good relationship, no matter who is elected.</p>
      <p><em>Interviewer Note:</em>  I attended one of the meetings where Aaron was present, before I knew who he was.Work and having a family/responsibilities also reduced my availability to attend, but I plan on joining the August Town Council Meeting.</p>
      <h3>Q1 - Campaign Finance: What are your top 3 sources for financing your campaign?</h3>
      <p>Self-funded, by Aaron Wheeler, with a separate treasurer to ensure compliance with applicable Alabama requirements.</p>
      <h3>Q2 - Campaign Operations: Who is running your campaign?</h3>
      <p>Aaron Wheeler.</p>
      <h2>Personal Relationships:</h2>
      <h3>Aaron-Only Question: Are you connected to the tree debris dump issue?</h3>
      <p>Aaron is a distant cousin to the owner but uninvolved with the activity/ownership, focusing on a positive campaign.</p>
      <p><em>Interviewer Note:</em> Research confirmed no connection beyond having the surname/last name. (Source: <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/apps/View/index.html?appid=b5118cb926c64ebeac59c8d0b01f6e45">Jefferson County GIS</a> 20 00 35 3 000 001.011 ) As interviewer, I felt compelled inform the public that he was not connected to this <a href="https://abc3340.com/news/local/sylvan-springs-residents-question-city-council-on-smoking-dump">well-known issue</a> over <a href="https://www.wvtm13.com/article/sylvan-springs-property-owner-finally-responding-to-burning-debris-1/3832829">the years.</a>  </p>
      <h2>Closing</h2>
      <h3>Is there anything else that you would like the residents of Sylvan Springs to know about you or your platform?</h3>
      <p>Interviewer note: As we had a long, detailed discussion, there wasn't anything else to cover at the time. I encouraged him to feel free to send any information he wants out there, informed him about the interview process/tactics that I am using, and the plan to also interview Stev in the same manner</p>
