            <h2 class="censored">OATH? WHAT OATH?: Mayor, Town Council Doubles-Down on Anti-1st Amendment Actions for Municipal Election Season</h2>
            <p class="propaganda">Comrades, behold the enlightened silence. Government wisely guides discourse. Sources: Approved Narratives Only. Original Story: Sanitized for Your Protection.</p>
            <p>There have been two Sylvan Springs Town Council meetings since mayoral candidate, Aaron Wheeler (R) applied/announced that he was running for election. July 15, 2025, which was when we were told the glorious, wise, and powerful Town Council voted to disable the comment section on the Sylvan Springs, AL government-run Facebook page.</p>
            <p>Citizens were expected to submit their identity at the front door sign in sheet on the table. Approved information was on the table. There was a Jefferson County Sheriff Deputy, who was there representing JCSO regarding National Night Out, ready to enforce the will of the great and wise glorious leader. We respect any man with a mustache as glorious and well kept as that deputy's.</p>
            <p class="censored">The Constitution of the United States of America.</p>
            <p class="censored">Early on, we raised our concerns with Stev Parsons. We believe that the 1st Amendment extends to any open comment thread that had previously been open and run by government, whether it is in a town council meeting or on the town's official Facebook page. The Supreme Court also seems to agree with this notion.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Case Law (Redacted for Harmony)</h2>
            <p class="censored">In the meeting, during public comment, it was shared that the town's action likely runs afoul of recent case law. To that, some council members either abruptly or angrily interrupted and fired back, that the town's attorneys reviewed it. In trying to discuss with Jason Reed of the town council, that discussion went more like an argument, so we gave up on him. We aren't attorneys, so we can't just cite case law from memory like a Bible verse, and none of them can either. I think he knows that.</p>
            <p class="censored">The short answer is: If a government-run Facebook page (or a government official acting with official authority) shuts off comments to stop discussion about the upcoming election, that's very likely unconstitutional viewpoint (or at least content) discrimination. If it were the page turning off all comments for everyone, for neutral reasons not related to what might be said, or if it might "embarrass" the municipality, courts have generally said that IS permissible.</p>
            <p class="censored">It is highly likely, that if the Town Council of Sylvan Springs turned off all comments for the purposes of prior restraint, preventing discussion about the election ahead of time that it would also fail the test and be ruled unconstitutional.</p>
            <p class="censored">Public forum rules apply to government social media. Classic doctrine (Perry/Cornelius) allows governments to set reasonable viewpoint-neutral rules in limited or designated public forums, but viewpoint discrimination is never allowed. Rosenberger underscores that this type of discrimination is the "egregious" First Amendment violation even in limited forums. Shutting comments because they're about elections targets subject matter (and often viewpoint) and is presumptively unlawful.</p>

            <h2>So What Happened to Sylvan Springs!? (Official Narrative)</h2>
            <p class="propaganda">Harmony Prevails. Justifications from Benevolent Officials:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="censored">The purpose wasn't for shutting down comments related to the upcoming election.</li>
                <li>The shutdown is permitted because it's ALL comments disabled.</li>
                <li>The public doesn't own it, the town does, not public domain.</li>
                <li>It's ok because attorneys approved it.</li>
                <li>Facebook page isn't/was never a public discussion forum so they're allowed to turn it off (per Jason Reed, Town Council, at the 8/20/2025 town council meeting).</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="censored">This discussion happened in the presence of Ricky Jones and Mrs. Jones, Stev Parsons and Jennifer Parsons, Andy Thompson and Mrs. Thompson. Note that if Stev wins and steps down, Rickey Jones becomes mayor as the Council President. </p>

            <h2>We Care About Accuracy (State-Approved Truth)</h2>
            <p class="censored">We do have receipts, including when we interviewed Stev in person, as well as the emails between us and Jennifer Parsons who was speaking on Stev's behalf. On Facebook on another topic related to candidate qualifications, Mrs. Parsons recently seemed to challenge us on what she actually did say, which we had a screenshot of. If we get something wrong, we're happy to update, amend, correct it, for our supreme leader.</p>
            <p class="censored">We get it... your team really never wanted this election to happen. We're aware of certain discussions that occurred to that effect.</p>

            <h2>RECEIPTS PLEASE!!! (Unredacted Evidence)</h2>
            <p>Please accept our apologies for the POOR quality of this video! You have a "front-row-seat" to the council meeting. This is the relevant part of the video.</p>
            <p>Stev Parsons doesn't like people on social media being able to say anything they want to accrding to the video.</p>

            <p>Post meeting discussion, the families of the mayor and councilmen agree, we need to silence speech that might be "embarrassing." This is in alignment with the wisdom of our glorious council, the source of all truth.</p>

            <p>Because we also know, one of our biggest fans may say we're taking things out of context, we also offer a full video of the town council meeting, so you can see it for yourself.</p>

One candidate playing fair, and trying to run a positive campaign. Aaron Wheeler. At this point, he's the only one that seems to truly support the US Constitution. If that changes, we'll call him out on that. He has our vote on 8/26/2025.</p>

        <h2>Actual Facts (Hidden in the Shadows)</h2>
        <p>The dystopian reality: Sylvan Springs shut off comments on their government-owned Facebook page to prevent talk about the election, stifling free speech in the name of "order."</p>
        <p>This action raises serious First Amendment concerns, as it may constitute impermissible viewpoint discrimination and content-based restrictions on public forums. Relevant case law includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lindke v. Freed, 601 U.S. 187 (2024)</strong>: The Supreme Court established a test for determining when a public official's social media activity constitutes state action, potentially making blocking or restricting access a First Amendment violation if done in an official capacity.<grok-card data-id="99339b" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card><grok-card data-id="99d3be" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card></li>
            <li><strong>O’Connor-Ratcliff v. Garnier, 601 U.S. 205 (2024)</strong>: Companion case emphasizing that officials cannot block critics from social media pages used for official purposes without violating free speech rights.<grok-card data-id="75707f" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card></li>
            <li><strong>Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University v. Trump, 928 F.3d 226 (2d Cir. 2019)</strong>: Held that blocking users from a government official's social media account based on their viewpoints violates the First Amendment, as the interactive space constitutes a public forum.<grok-card data-id="ac86f6" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card></li>
            <li><strong>Davison v. Randall, 912 F.3d 666 (4th Cir. 2019)</strong>: Banning a user from a government official's Facebook page for critical comments was ruled unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination.<grok-card data-id="a98afc" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card><grok-card data-id="3e00ef" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card></li>
        </ul>
        <p>While shutting off all comments might seem content-neutral, doing so specifically to suppress election-related discussions can be seen as a pretext for viewpoint discrimination, barred under these precedents. Governments cannot close public forums merely to avoid disfavored speech.<grok-card data-id="15aded" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card><grok-card data-id="c07f3b" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card></p>
