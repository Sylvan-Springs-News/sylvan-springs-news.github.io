      <h2>OATH? WHAT OATH?: Mayor, Town Council Doubles-Down on Anti-1st Amendment Actions for Municipal Election Season</h2>
      <h3>When did we get to a point where government could choose what you're allowed to speak about?</h3>
      <h4>Sources: US Constitution, Town Council Meeting Recording</h3>
      <h5>Original Story: August 13, 2025, based on August 12, 2025 Council Meeting</h5>

      <p>There have been two Sylvan Springs Town Council meetings since mayoral candidate, Aaron Wheeler (R) applied/announced that he was running for election. July 15, 2025, which was when we were told the Town Council voted to disable the open comment section on the Sylvan Springs, AL government-run Facebook page. </p>
      <p>This meeting was a little different from past meetings. There was a sign-in sheet at front, which people can't be forced to sign, else it would violate the 4th Amendment. There was a meeting agenda printout (<a href="Agenda20250812.pdf" target=_blank>PDF link</a>). There was a Jefferson County Sheriff Deputy, who was there representing JCSO regarding National Night Out. That seemed a little coordinated for it to be a coincidence, but it is what it is. We respect any man with a mustache as glorious and well kept as that deputy's.</p>
      <p>In our interview with Stev Parsons, we asked him what the components of the 1st Amendment was, and he did have trouble answering. We helped him, and in hindsight as an interviewer, I was wrong. I should have reported it as it really was. As mayor, and members of the Town Council, more than likely they swore an oath to uphold and defend the US Constitution. However, in 2025, the first election in over 20 years for mayor of Sylvan Springs, it seems that our elected officials either aren't aware of what they swore an oath to, or they are aware and they choose to ignore/discard/trample on the most important, basic and supreme law of this great nation which made us great - The Constitution of the United States of America.</p>
      <p>Early on, we raised our concerns about the 1st Amendment implications of this during our interview with Stev Parsons. Where we disagree, is we believe that the 1st Amendment extends to any open comment thread that had previously been open and run by government, whether it is in a town council meeting or on the town's official Facebook page. The Supreme Court also seems to agree with this notion.</p>

    <p><b>Case Law</b><br/>
    In the meeting, during public comment, it was shared that the town's action likely runs afoul of recent case law. To that, some council members either abruptly or angrily interrupted and fired back, that the town's attorneys reviewed it. <i>We don't know about you, but last I recall, the Supreme Court of the United States opinions sort of outranks the lawyers for a 1500-population town.</i> In trying to discuss with Jason Reed of the town council, that discussion went more like an argument, so we gave up on him. We aren't attorneys, so we can't just cite case law from memory like a Bible verse, and none of them can either. I think he knows that.<br/><br/>
    <em><b>The short answer is:</b> If a government-run Facebook page (or a government official acting with official authority) shuts off comments to <b>stop discussion about the upcoming election,</b> that's very likely <b>unconstitutional viewpoint (or at least content) discrimination.</b> If it were the page turning off all comments for everyone, <b>for neutral reasons not related to what might be said, or if it might "embarrass" the municipality,</b> courts have generally said that IS permissible.</em></p>

    <p>In Davison v Randall (4th Cir. 2019), the court held the "interactive space" of an official Facebook page is a <b>public forum</b>; blocking a critic for accusing officials of corruption was <b>viewpoint discrimination</b> and violated the First Amendment. It is highly likely, that if the Town Council of Sylvan Springs turned off all comments <i> for the purposes of prior restraint, preventing discussion about the election ahead of time</i> that it would also fail the test and be ruled unconstitutional.</p>

    <p>Public forum rules apply to government social media. Classic doctrine (Perry/Cornelius) allows governments to set reasonable viewpoint-neutral rules in limited or designated public forums, <b>but viewpoint discrimination is never allowed.</b> Rosenberger underscores that this type of discrimination is the "egregious" First Amendment violation even in limited forums. Shutting comments <b>because they're about elections</b> targets subject matter (and often viewpoint) and is presumptively unlawful.</p>

    
    <p><b>So What Happened to Sylvan Springs!? (Or, what happened in that meeting?)</b>Here are the things we were told by various officials in your Sylvan Springs government, as the justification to their actions, in order of chronology:
      <ul>
        <li>The purpose wasn't for shutting down comments related to the upcoming election.</li>
        <li>The shutdown is permitted because it's ALL comments disabled.</li>
        <li>The public doesn't own it, the town does, not public domain.</li>
        <li>It's ok because attorneys approved it.</li>
        <li>Facebook page isn't/was never a public discussion forum so they're allowed to turn it off (per Jason Reed, Town Council, at the 8/20/2025 town council meeting).</li>
      </ul> <br/>
      Ricky Jones, after the meeting, seemed to be angry, taking it as a personal insult, when we said that we're really disappointed in the town council for doing wrong, and then doubling down on it. He tried to say we said different, but we repeated this same thing three times. This discussion happened in the presence of Ricky Jones and Mrs. Jones, Stev Parsons and Jennifer Parsons, Andy Thompson and Mrs. Thompson. Note that if Stev wins and steps down, Rickey Jones becomes mayor as the Council President. <b>We truly wonder what the next excuse for violating the US Constitution that they swore an oath to will be, since they are all <i>patriotic and conservative republicans</i>... or what makes it ok for people to try and keep people from talking about this election.</b>
    </p>

    <h4>We care about accuracy.</h4>
    <p>We were also challenged in terms of our integrity, face to face, by a couple individuals trying to say that we lied, distorted or got things wrong. We take the truth seriously, and we do have receipts, including when we interviewed Stev in person, as well as the emails between us and Jennifer Parsons who was speaking on Stev's behalf. On Facebook on another topic related to candidate qualifications, Mrs. Parsons recently seemed to challenge us on what she actually did say, which we had a screenshot of.<b>If we get something wrong, we're happy to update, amend, correct it, but you do not get to twist things in to the most favorable view to you after it was said. You do not get to silence it either. <u>Sure, you can heckle, try to discredit, let your friends and family verbally tear us down and cause us harm - then look the other way - but does that make us want to vote for you? Um, no. You could have even stopped and said, maybe what we're doing is wrong, let's fix it or try. Instead, deflecting and doubling down.</u></b><br/>
    We get it... your team really never wanted this election to happen. We're aware of certain discussions that occurred to that effect.</p>



    <h2>RECEIPTS PLEASE!!!</h2>
    <p>Please accept our apologies for the POOR quality of this video! You have a "front-row-seat" to the council meeting. This is the relevant part of the video.

    <h4>Rickey Jones: "What do you have against the council? You said you was against us." Our response: Oh no we did not. (I guess he didn't see the camera.)<br/><br/>
  
    Jason Reed of the Town Council fires back at the idea that the council made a mistake, and admits that the purpose of turning comments off was to stop discussion, directly after July 11, 2025.</h4>

    <h4>Post meeting discussion, the families of the mayor and councilmen, seemingly defending the idea that we can silence speech that might be "embarrassing." This is exactly our concern - a violation of the US Constitution, the 1st Amendment.</h4>

    <h2>Opinion</h2>
    <h3>Aaron Wheeler is the only candidate who is considering the US Constitution right now.</h3>
    <p>When it counts, there has been only one candidate who didn't gaslight us. One candidate whose supporters didn't try to destroy us. One candidate playing fair, and trying to run a positive campaign. <b>Aaron Wheeler. At this point, he's the only one that seems to truly support the US Constitution. If that changes, we'll call him out on that. He has our vote on 8/26/2025.</b><br/><br/>

    Because we also know, one of our biggest fans may say we're taking things out of context, we also offer a <a href="https://youtu.be/EFMyHnCvD-o" target=_blank>full video of the town council meeting,</a> so you can see it for yourself.
