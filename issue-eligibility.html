            <p class="censored">In the What's Happening in Sylvan Springs? Facebook group, the civil war wages on between supporters of the 20+ year incumbent mayor, Stev Parsons, and other citizens who are either undecided or supporters of Aaron Wheeler. In what we have seen, much of the anger seems to be around the very existence of the question, or the discussion around election, electability.</p>
            <p class="censored">In one particular post, a concern was raised about the health status of our mayor, which is a valid question, and out of genuine concern as well. If Stev (or even Aaron) wins and then steps down/seat vacates for any reason, it would cause the Council President (Current: Rickey Jones) to be appointed as mayor, until a special election or for remainder of term.</p>
            <p>It is notable, that while there are some rough responses from Mrs. Parsons attempting to represent Stev online, Aaron Wheeler and his wife seem to be showing respect to citizens who have concerns about him, not arguing. You can't blame Jimbo for Billybob's actions. The devil didn't make us do it - the Bible busted that myth already. This aligns with Mr. Wheeler's idea that we need to be a closer community, discussed in our interview with him. What he said and is doing so far, seems to verify.</p>

             <img src="ophealth.png">
            <p>There was a post, which we couldn't find anymore, where the mayor's wife/representative Jennifer Parsons, had responded to someone else on this question. In that post, Mrs. Parsons indicated that if Stev Parsons' health was not good, he would not have qualified for re-election. For us, the most important thing, we are happy to hear Dr. Parsons is in good health. We grew up knowing this family and their contribution to our county and town.</p>

            <h2 class="censored">Opinion: Measure, Ask, Discuss... in a civil manner.</h2>
            <p class="censored">It is unfortunate that in Mrs. Parsons acting as a representative in a campaign, she has chosen to misrepresent Alabama law concerning the election. There were some past discussions that we have had with Mrs. Parsons, which left us feeling a bit unsatisfied with the answers on First Amendment grounds on another issue as well.</p>
            <p class="censored">We hope we are able to live with each other after this. We can't be doing the things, shown in the screen captures below, and you can't rightly blame the existence of an election - it's a part of life in the best country on Earth: USA. History and our creator will judge us, as will our children, based on how we handled ourselves here.</p>
            <p>From the same discussion thread, more mud slinging than a pottery house ran by animals</p>
            <!-- Assuming image embed here, kept uncensored -->
            <p class="censored">More than a few citizens that we have talked to, has mentioned Dr. Parsons was in rough shape - with care in their voice, and the response from Jennifer Parsons seemed discussing efforts to quiet the rumors, labelling it as nothing more than "political propaganda," which doesn't align to our recent interview discussing the important with open dialogue in elections, and transparency. She even followed up to tell a citizen "be careful."  Rumors SHOULD be discussed, and quickly verified or busted before it festers into.....what we have here.... This is to allow voters to get an understanding of what is real or mythical. Sunlight is the best disinfectant. We don't support falsehoods either, but who gets to decide/arbitrate that in an election? The voters.</p>
            <!-- Assuming image embed here, kept uncensored -->
            <p class="censored">The question as to Dr. Parsons health is not a new question. Later in this exchange, another citizen said they were concerned. In this town, when someone says they're concerned for a person's health, they mean it. However, the response from others wasn't savory in the least. Almost like this person was speaking on behalf of the Parsons campaign. We aren't sure if that was the case, or if there's any official campaign connection.</p>
            <!-- Assuming image embeds here, kept uncensored -->
            <p class="censored">This is where we were taken back quite a bit. Whoa there. This message was direct from Mrs. Parsons to a citizen.</p>
            <p class="censored">So far, we haven't seen Aaron Wheeler nor his Wife engaging in this kind of thing. To us, this aligns with the idea of trying to unite people, rather than have civil war. That's a show of respect and character, even in the midst of social media power struggles.</p>

        <h2>Actual Facts (Hidden in the Shadows)</h2>
        <p>The dystopian reality: Sylvan Springs shut off comments on their government-owned Facebook page to prevent talk about the election, stifling free speech in the name of "order."</p>
        <p>This action raises serious First Amendment concerns, as it may constitute impermissible viewpoint discrimination and content-based restrictions on public forums. Relevant case law includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lindke v. Freed, 601 U.S. 187 (2024)</strong>: The Supreme Court established a test for determining when a public official's social media activity constitutes state action, potentially making blocking or restricting access a First Amendment violation if done in an official capacity.<grok-card data-id="230dc6" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card><grok-card data-id="d6f29d" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card></li>
            <li><strong>O’Connor-Ratcliff v. Garnier, 601 U.S. 205 (2024)</strong>: Companion case to Lindke, emphasizing that officials cannot block critics from social media pages used for official purposes without violating free speech rights.<grok-card data-id="cb7df7" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card><grok-card data-id="2817bf" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card></li>
            <li><strong>Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University v. Trump, 928 F.3d 226 (2d Cir. 2019)</strong>: Held that blocking users from a government official's social media account based on their viewpoints violates the First Amendment, as the interactive space constitutes a public forum.<grok-card data-id="4fdb67" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card></li>
            <li><strong>Davison v. Randall, 912 F.3d 666 (4th Cir. 2019)</strong>: Banning a user from a government official's Facebook page for critical comments was ruled unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination.<grok-card data-id="15d022" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card></li>
        </ul>
        <p>While shutting off all comments might seem content-neutral, doing so specifically to suppress election-related discussions can be seen as a pretext for viewpoint discrimination, barred under these precedents. Governments cannot close public forums merely to avoid disfavored speech.<grok-card data-id="fd6e0b" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card><grok-card data-id="072eb1" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card></p>
