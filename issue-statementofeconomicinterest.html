      <h2>Opinion Section:</h2>
      <p>We reached out to a member of What's Happening in Sylvan Springs? (non-2.0 group) for a quote:<br/>
        <em>"REEEEEE! IMMATURE! RAWR! CASHMEOUSIDEHOWBOWDAT?! ADMINPLS BAN THEM! HOWDAREYOUASKQUESTIONS!"</em><br/>
        Not really, but screechin Karens gonna screech no matter what you do. You could wash Jesus's feet personally and they'd have a problem with it.... <br/><br/>We've decided that Aaron's team seems to be the most sensible, with a lot less of the hateful stuff going on. Unlike Stev's team, where we got a cold shoulder at town hall from council members obviously supporting Steve, we were welcomed by Aaron's  team, even though we ourselves were firmly on Stev's side at the time. <i>That's right, we started out supporting Stev as a team, but being neutral in coverage for the interviews, until they didn't seem to care for our vote enough to step up, communicate, and say "this is not right to treat neighbors poorly."</i> <br/>
        <b>What kind of people do you want ruling the town for the next 4 years? People who are kind, or people who try and destroy or silence you? It could be you next.</b><br/>
