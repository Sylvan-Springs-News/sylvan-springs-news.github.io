      <h2>2025 Mayoral Candidate: Stevan Parsons (R)(I)</h2>
      Candidate Occupation: Mayor (Source: <a href="https://sylvanspringsal.com/administration/mayor-and-council/">Sylvan Springs</a>)<br />
      Interviewer: Casey Benefield<br />
      Interviewed: 7/27/2025<br />
      First Published: <br />
      
    <h3>Interviewer Transparency</h3>

    <p><em>This article is not a 100% direct quote of the candidate, but written based on an understanding of the notes taken during the interview. The author is unaffiliated with Stev Parsons, the campaign, not compensated in any way. This is the second time having an in-person meeting with Mayor Stev.<br/><br/>
    This article was presented to Stev Parsons prior to publishing, to ensure that nothing was misunderstood or misstated. Both this candiate and the competitor's interview were published on the exact same date and time. The interview template used for both candidates was the same, except for specific questions related only to the candidate/online concerns that we have seen posted. The competitors were not allowed to view the other's interview content prior to publication. We may publish a separate follow-up.<br/><br/>The opinions expressed are not necessarily the opinions of the author, site owner, affiliates/employers, for the purpose of this article.</p>

    <h2>Candidate's Opening Thoughts on Issues/Concerns</h2>

    <p>"THe biggest thing for us as a small town is reaching out to find ways to pull revnue. We've been fortunate" to have a dollar general. In history there have been things we've done with that revenue, such as the tornado shelter, as a result of our look to find those resoures to avoid having out of pocket money. Revenue is tight in small towns, based on the tax revenue sources. Going back to building the town hall, it was an effort from several entities as a source, grants and things of that nature, to build this whole new facility. The people are wonderful people, and for years you'd know everyone in town. It's still not a huge metro situation, where there's a big box store there, but we are looking to find good sources for new revenue. It hasn't limited us to a situation where we don't have anything by any means. We have avoided indebtedness.<br/>
    </p>

    <h2>Foundational Beliefs</h2>
  <h3>Q1 - Why are you running for mayor?</h3>
    <p>Stev has been committed for this long, and we continue to improve each year moving foward. I want that to continue. We have grandkids and great grandkids here. It's home, and we enjoy it. We want to keep that going. Our past mayors, councils have worked hard to ensure our town is a reputable town, they hear Sylvan Springs, recognize the name, and that it is a nice place to live.<br/>
      Will we get a big box store? Who knows, but whatever resources are available, and whatever we can do to make our citizens complete and whole, that's what we're looking at.<br/>
      Stev is happy with knowing in Sylvan Springs, that he can lay down at night and know they are safe.
    </p>
    <h3>Q2 - What are your beliefs about the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights? Should citizens ever have to trade one Constitutional right for another?</h3>
    <p>Our forefathers wrote it and it is what it is. I wouldn't change it. It isn't meant to be changed. Citizens should not have to trade a right for another.
    </p>

    <h3>Q3 - Can you name the five freedoms guaranteed by the first amendment?</h3>
    <p>Interviewer Notes: Steve got 5/5. Please note: These are easy to miss/forget as an average citizen, and many officers who swore an oath to the Constitution can't answer this question on-the-spot. The answers are Religion, Speech, Press, Assembly, Petition.</p>
    <p>For our readers, here's an accurate AI-generated definition, boiling it down:
      <ul>
        <li>Religion - This component protects the right to practice any religion or no religion at all. It prevents the government from establishing an official religion and guarantees the free exercise of religion.</li>
        <li>Speech - This right ensures that individuals can express their thoughts and opinions without government interference. It allows for public debate, criticism of the government, and advocacy for change.</li>
        <li>Press - This right safeguards the independence of the media, allowing journalists to report on government activities without fear of retaliation. It plays a crucial role in holding those in power accountable. The citizens are the press, corporation not required.</li>
        <li>Assembly - This freedom allows individuals to gather in public spaces to express their views, protest injustices, and advocate for change. It ensures that citizens can come together to voice their concerns.</li>
        <li>Petition - This right enables individuals to address grievances to the government and seek redress for issues that affect them. It empowers citizens to hold elected officials accountable and advocate for policies that align with their beliefs.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Q4 - Have you made a records request in Sylvan Springs?</h3>
    <p>No.</p>
    <p><em>Interviewer Note:</em> The mayor has access to the records, so this question is not fully applicable. Public records, like fire department call data, can highlight issues (e.g., illegal burning) or inform prevention efforts. Data analysis should aim for unbiased, actionable insights, unlike potentially biased traditional media. Data Analysis as a practice is about providing high quality actionable insights based on what the data tells you, not making the data tell you what you want it to say.</p>
   <h3>Q5 - Should town-owned social media allow free speech like in-person forums?</h3>
   <p>Stev: "There is free speech. Can we prevent that from happening? No. Anyone that has ever come to town hall has been allowed to speak. Some choose to do a yelling match, and that was not allowed, until some of the attitude was changed. Done in the proper way, they can speak, and we'll listen." <br/>

    Informed Stev, that the town FB page had comments disabled.<br/>
    Stev's followup is that his opinion is, if there's something to say, best to say it face to face, especially if not agreed on. Stev says, "Today in social media, people can say anything, and they don't care. Once it hits social media, you can't bring it back. I've seen too many people hurt, harmed, affected badly, be it business or person. It's almost like we hide behind and throw snowballs, rather than having a conversation.""
   </p>
    
    <h2>Fiscal Policy</h2>
    <h3>Q1 - Will you be supporting raising taxes to accomplish the goals you have as mayor?</h3>
    <p>Stev: "We will evaluate, but I don't know that we would actually do that unless it is the right thing to do."<br/>
      "Sylvan Springs doesn't set the taxes, it would have to be a Jefferson County thing. That is not something I would like to do, but there are so many other options for funding. I would rather reach out to other areas to obtain funding in different ways, instead of adding tax."<br/>
      "The town's budget is balanced, and we are debt free, with money in the bank."<br/>
      "To build the town hall building, we did a bond, and we still have money in that account after building, so we are still in good shape financially. With what's out there for other project funding, there's opportunities. We prefer to operate without debt. Financially the town is very sound."
    </p>
    <h2>Local Issues</h2>
    <h3>Q1 - Fire Department Governance: Do you support the fire department's current autonomy in its operations?</h3>
    <p>"At this point in time, if it isn't broken, no need to change. It's working very well so far."</p>
    <p>Interviewer Note: The current governance model has the fire chief in charge of operational decision, with council oversight, inclusive of large spending decisions.</p>
    <h3>Q2 - Infrastructure/Roads: We heard pot holes on Sunset Dr was a concern. AL-269 seems to be a state road not getting a lot of care. What is your proposal to fix this ongoing issue?</h3>
    <p>We've been in the process, and have hired an independent contractor doing the patching work. We used to be able to go through the county, and have them come to do that patch work, but the county can no longer manage that. Part of it is the new hospital in McCalla. Jefferson County is doing the road work for the hospital, and that took them out of being able to help smaller municipalities. <br/> The thing to keep in mind, paving roads is a huge financial cost, filling potholes, or paving a few miles. We try to put as much money as we can into the roads so that we'll have it. We also can't do these jobs in the winter time, only Spring/Summer. We've gotten several done since hiring a contractor.<br/>
      
    Dropoff on Sunset Dr, the biggest problem with that road is when you go around the curve, it's a drop off. There's not a lot of room to put anything there. That's where we have difficulties, maintaining something that'll stay. There have been rods driven in to try to shore it up. There's a drainage ditch going through, and water going off the hill cutting into the hill.<br/>
  This is under ongoing examination, a hot topic and a high priority.</p>

    <h2>Crime and Rental Properties</h2>
    <h3>Q1 - Addiction/mental health issues is a growing concern nationwide, and our town isn't an exception. SSFD runs a few calls a year for this type of thing. What are your thoughts on this issue?</h3>
    <p>Content</p>
    <p><em>Interviewer Note:</em> Mayoral influence is limited, but closer communities often manage better. The town lacks a police force and cannot feasibly budget for one. Government stigma/national events may also deter those who may seek help.</p>
    <h3>Q2 - Some residents are concerned about crime, from individuals from outside our town. There was previous talk of rental property restrictions or fees in Sylvan Springs Council Meetings, noting that this could be a discrimination concern. How would new restrictions on rental properties reduce crime?</h3>
    <p>Not thinking that would reduce crime. First, we need to look at how many rentals we have. I don't think there's that many rentals. A fee might deter some of it. I don't know that you could mandate any restrictions. It may come down to private property rights.</p>
    
    <h3>Q3 - Will you impose new restrictions on landowners’ property use?</h3>
    <p>I'm open only if it warrants. Need to be careful when trying to regulate. We've got enough restrictions already in place, and most of the time it's a matter of communicating/knowledge first, before we start putting things in place.</p>
    <p>I<em>Interviewer Note:</em> Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office reportedly doesn’t enforce town ordinances. Not a directly mayoral issue, but a concern. Dog-related issues, including attacks and abandonment, have persisted, with recent regional dog mauling deaths raising concerns. Of note, Jefferson County Animal Control has been inconsistent in servicing the Sylvan Springs area at times.<br/>
      <b>History of dog-related issues:</b> Over the past 5 years, there had been a newsletter or two that brought up the leash law, or dogs at-large. Near Julians/Old Southern Hardware, and the streets behind, there have been a few situations of dogs at large or abandoned. In 2020, we adopted a dog that a breeder had dumped in the neighborhood. There have been chickens lost to dogs. There was also a dog attack in the neighborhood, which didn't make the news. Owner of that dog was not held accountable. In 2023-2024, there were two dogs dumped by individuals that lived on another road in Sylvan Springs, and the dogs were not only food aggressive, but tried to attack the wife - who jumped the fence to avoid them. Imagine if this had been a child. Another news story. This month, July 2025, someone dumped a pit bull in the area. This pit bull, so far as we know, hasn't attacked, <em>but this trend is a concern</em>, in light of two deaths from maulings in Bessemer, AL in the news <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2025/07/woman-found-dead-in-grassy-lot-in-bessemer-was-fatally-mauled-by-dogs.html">on al.com</a>, and a second attack, which was covered by <a href="https://www.wvtm13.com/article/second-deadly-dog-attack-in-3-days-in-central-alabama/65514215">WVTM/Channel 13 News</a>.</p>
      <h2>Economic Development</h2>
      <h3>Q1 - How will you attract businesses to Sylvan Springs?</h3>
      <p>Everyone thinks we want a fast food place, but there's limits on what they will do. Some time back, we did contact the Jack's company. We found them to be easier to deal with on locations, but their criteria would not fit because of one in Pleasant Grove. There's criteria there of course.<br/>
      That being said, if I was looking for more business, I'd look for another category, not sure what that would be. Thinking about people who would open businesses like services businesses, quality local businesses.</p>
      <p><em>Interviewer Note:</em> To illustrate the considerations of running a business, we will use a fast-food restaurant (like Jack's) as an example. <br />
        Sylvan Springs population in 2023 was 1559, with 57% being over 18 (889) (Source: <a href="https://censusreporter.org/profiles/16000US0174424-sylvan-springs-al/">CensusReporter.org</a>). A typical fast food restaurant requires an average of 200-300 customers daily in order to cover its costs (Source: <a href="https://dojobusiness.com/blogs/news/fast-food-restaurant-daily-customers">BusinessDojo</a>). <em><b>This means at least 22%, or 1 in 4 adult Sylvan Springs residents would have to choose to eat fast food daily, for a fast-food business to survive. That doesn't sound healthy or sustainable.</b></em> In closing, new businesses will need to have an understanding of their market area, and how to turn a profit with a good flow of business to survive.</p>
      <h3>Q2 - How will you address underperforming schools that Sylvan Springs is zoned for?</h3>
      <p>We are all about education, and increasing that opportunity. Home schools are out there, there's a lot of private schools still out there today. Jefferson County is not into changing zones. It would have to be on our end or find some kind of resources who have knowledge on that topic to get the information out there.</p>
      <h2>Community Events</h2>
      <h3>Q1 - What community events do you propose?</h3>
      <p>We were doing National Night Out, but this year there is new leadership with JCSO. This past year's event was a bit less than what it should have been. Considering park movie nights, our own national night out, hopefully getting that on track in the fall. We usually have great turnout in the past sheriff administrations, and even other departments like Concord were there. We're regrouping to see if we can get it back in order, and hopefully add some more to it.</p>
      <h2>Campaign Visibility and Transparency</h2>

      <h3>Q1 - Campaign Finance: What are your top 3 sources for financing your campaign?</h3>
      <p>Self.</p>
      <h3>Q2 - Campaign Operations: Who is running your campaign?</h3>
      <p>My wife and I, home owned, home operated.</p>
      <h2>Personal Relationships:</h2>
      <h3>No questions were presented.</h3>
      <p></p>
      <h2>Closing</h2>
      <h3>Is there anything else that you would like the residents of Sylvan Springs to know about you or your platform?</h3>
      <p>"I enjoy serving Sylvan Springs, and have for years, and if given the opportunity, I would like to continue on. There are things to improve on as we all have. I've raised my kids and grandkids here, and it has been a grand ole town. We want to keep it moving in that direction in the future."</p>
