    <h3>Interviewer Transparency</h3>

    <p><em>This article is not a 100% direct quote of the candidate, but written based on an understanding of the notes taken during the interview. The author is unaffiliated with Stev Parsons, the campaign, not compensated in any way. This is the second time having an in-person meeting with Mayor Stev.<br/><br/>
    This article was presented to Stev Parsons prior to publishing, to ensure that nothing was misunderstood or misstated. Both this candiate and the competitor's interview were published on the exact same date and time. The interview template used for both candidates was the same, except for specific questions related only to the candidate/online concerns that we have seen posted. The competitors were not allowed to view the other's interview content prior to publication. We may publish a separate follow-up.<br/><br/>The opinions expressed are not necessarily the opinions of the author, site owner, affiliates/employers, for the purpose of this article.</p>

    <h2>Candidate's Opening Thoughts on Issues/Concerns</h2>
    <p><b>"Quote Summary from Candidate goes here."</b><br/>
    
    Content.</p>

    <h2>Foundational Beliefs</h2>
  <h3>Q1 - Why are you running for mayor?</h3>
    <p>Content.</p>
    <h3>Q2 - What are your beliefs about the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights? Should citizens ever have to trade one Constitutional right for another?</h3>
    <p>Content</p>
    <h3>Q3 - Can you name the five freedoms guaranteed by the first amendment?</h3>
    <p>Interviewer Notes: Steve got ?/5, only missing ??? Please note: These are easy to miss/forget as an average citizen, and many officers who swore an oath to the Constitution can't answer this question on-the-spot. The answers are Religion, Speech, Press, Assembly, Petition.</p>
    <p>For our readers, here's an accurate AI-generated definition, boiling it down:
      <ul>
        <li>Religion - This component protects the right to practice any religion or no religion at all. It prevents the government from establishing an official religion and guarantees the free exercise of religion.</li>
        <li>Speech - This right ensures that individuals can express their thoughts and opinions without government interference. It allows for public debate, criticism of the government, and advocacy for change.</li>
        <li>Press - This right safeguards the independence of the media, allowing journalists to report on government activities without fear of retaliation. It plays a crucial role in holding those in power accountable. The citizens are the press, corporation not required.</li>
        <li>Assembly - This freedom allows individuals to gather in public spaces to express their views, protest injustices, and advocate for change. It ensures that citizens can come together to voice their concerns.</li>
        <li>Petition - This right enables individuals to address grievances to the government and seek redress for issues that affect them. It empowers citizens to hold elected officials accountable and advocate for policies that align with their beliefs.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Q4 - Have you made a records request in Sylvan Springs?</h3>
    <p>Content</p>
    <p><em>Interviewer Note:</em> Public records, like fire department call data, can highlight issues (e.g., illegal burning) or inform prevention efforts. Data analysis should aim for unbiased, actionable insights, unlike potentially biased traditional media. Data Analysis as a practice is about providing high quality actionable insights based on what the data tells you, not making the data tell you what you want it to say.</p>
   <h3>Q5 - Should town-owned social media allow free speech like in-person forums?</h3>
   <p>Content.</p>
    
    <h2>Fiscal Policy</h2>
    <h3>Q1 - Will you be supporting raising taxes to accomplish the goals you have as mayor?</h3>
    <p>Content.</p>
    <h2>Local Issues</h2>
    <h3>Q1 - Fire Department Governance: Do you support the fire department's current autonomy in its operations?</h3>
    <p>Content.</p>
    <p>Interviewer Note: The current governance model has the fire chief in charge of operational decision, with council oversight, inclusive of large spending decisions.</p>
    <h3>Q2 - Infrastructure/Roads: We heard pot holes on Sunset Dr was a concern. AL-269 seems to be a state road not getting a lot of care. What is your proposal to fix this ongoing issue?</h3>
    <p>Content.</p>

    <h2>Crime and Rental Properties</h2>
    <h3>Q1 - Addiction/mental health issues is a growing concern nationwide, and our town isn't an exception. SSFD runs a few calls a year for this type of thing. What are your thoughts on this issue?</h3>
    <p>Content</p>
    <p><em>Interviewer Note:</em> Mayoral influence is limited, but closer communities often manage better. The town lacks a police force and cannot feasibly budget for one. Government stigma/national events may also deter those who may seek help.</p>
    <h3>Q2 - Some residents are concerned about crime, from individuals from outside our town. There was previous talk of rental property restrictions or fees in Sylvan Springs Council Meetings, noting that this could be a discrimination concern. How would new restrictions on rental properties reduce crime?</h3>
    <p>Content.</p>
    
    <h3>Q3 - Will you impose new restrictions on landowners’ property use?</h3>
    <p>Content.</p>
    <p>I<em>Interviewer Note:</em> Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office reportedly doesn’t enforce town ordinances. Not a directly mayoral issue, but a concern. Dog-related issues, including attacks and abandonment, have persisted, with recent regional dog mauling deaths raising concerns. Of note, Jefferson County Animal Control has been inconsistent in servicing the Sylvan Springs area at times.<br/>
      <b>History of dog-related issues:</b> Over the past 5 years, there had been a newsletter or two that brought up the leash law, or dogs at-large. Near Julians/Old Southern Hardware, and the streets behind, there have been a few situations of dogs at large or abandoned. In 2020, we adopted a dog that a breeder had dumped in the neighborhood. Later, another dog got ahold and killed a chicken, leaving it on our property until we figured out where a terrible decomposing smell was coming from. A year later, a neighbor down the road has two dogs, one often ran free. The new dog ended up attacking our dog and the wife, causing us to take our dog to the veterinarian for stitches. Owner never paid any bills nor was held accountable. In 2023-2024, there were two dogs dumped by individuals that lived on another road in Sylvan Springs, and the dogs were not only food aggressive, but tried to attack the wife - who jumped the fence to avoid them. Imagine if this had been a child. Another news story. This month, July 2025, someone dumped a pit bull in the area. This pit bull, so far as we know, hasn't attacked, <em>but this trend is a concern</em>, in light of two deaths from maulings in Bessemer, AL in the news <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2025/07/woman-found-dead-in-grassy-lot-in-bessemer-was-fatally-mauled-by-dogs.html">on al.com</a>, and a second attack, which was covered by <a href="https://www.wvtm13.com/article/second-deadly-dog-attack-in-3-days-in-central-alabama/65514215">WVTM/Channel 13 News</a>.</p>
      <h2>Economic Development</h2>
      <h3>Q1 - How will you attract businesses to Sylvan Springs?</h3>
      <p>Content.</p>
      <p><em>Interviewer Note:</em> To illustrate the considerations of running a business, we will use a fast-food restaurant (like Jack's) as an example. <br />
        Sylvan Springs population in 2023 was 1559, with 57% being over 18 (889) (Source: <a href="https://censusreporter.org/profiles/16000US0174424-sylvan-springs-al/">CensusReporter.org</a>). A typical fast food restaurant requires an average of 200-300 customers daily in order to cover its costs (Source: <a href="https://dojobusiness.com/blogs/news/fast-food-restaurant-daily-customers">BusinessDojo</a>). <em><b>This means at least 22%, or 1 in 4 adult Sylvan Springs residents would have to choose to eat fast food daily, for a fast-food business to survive. That doesn't sound healthy or sustainable.</b></em> In closing, new businesses will need to have an understanding of their market area, and how to turn a profit with a good flow of business to survive.</p>
      <h3>Q2 - How will you address underperforming schools that Sylvan Springs is zoned for?</h3>
      <p>Content.</p>
      <h2>Community Events</h2>
      <h3>Q1 - What community events do you propose?</h3>
      <p>Content.</p>
      <h2>Campaign Visibility and Transparency</h2>

      <h3>Q1 - Campaign Finance: What are your top 3 sources for financing your campaign?</h3>
      <p>Content.</p>
      <h3>Q2 - Campaign Operations: Who is running your campaign?</h3>
      <p>Content</p>
      <h2>Personal Relationships:</h2>
      <h3>No questions were presented.</h3>
      <p></p>
      <h2>Closing</h2>
      <h3>Is there anything else that you would like the residents of Sylvan Springs to know about you or your platform?</h3>
