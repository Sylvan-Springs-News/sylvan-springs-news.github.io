      <h2>Opinion: Fake or Real? </h2>
      <h3>Sylvan Springs election and understanding fact vs unverified hearsay.</h3>
      <h5>Original Story: July 31, 2025</h5>

    <p>It has been quite a week for us. The first duty and order of business was to flush out what the candidates, Aaron Wheeler and Stevan Parsons, had to say about a curated list of issues, which was generated by an AI.</p>
    <p>So about that AI.... Don't worry, our AI isn't watching you, and Skynet isn't going to summon the Borg from the Delta Quadrant to come assimilate earth. This website was HAND CODED, in static HTML, and doesn't even have trackers. If you use a privacy centric browser like Brave, your shields will show 0 trackers. <b>Pretty extreme opening, right? That's the point. Myths busted. </b></p>

    <p>In our town we only see the tip of the iceberg online, and in some circles, we still (thankfully) live offline in the real world. However, even person-to-person, some shenanigans can happen. Distortion, misleading, lies, and damn lies could come from anywhere. Test and verify what you hear, and be a healthy skeptic. <b>If we really care about our town, future generations, we have to think strategically, vote based on what is better for us at local, state, and federal election time, instead of *who we like*. Show the youth how it's done, rather than sitting back criticizing. Show up at meetings. Turn a screwdriver, mow some grass, whatever it takes.</b> Let's face it, the left and the right are acting strangely similar, encouraging us citizens to turn on each other, ignoring our founding principles in the US Constitution, and even trying to get us to trade our neighbors' rights off in exchange for not being disagreed with. It's one elite uniparty, as Elon Musk tends to say.</p>
    <p><em>This isn't to say we won't talk about rumors. Talking about them is important to either verify or bust a myth in its tracks. Sunlight is a great disinfectant.</em></p>
    
    <h2>Where the rubber meets the road: What AI thinks about it...</h2>
      <p>In an election, especially a rare one like the first mayoral race in 20 years, discerning truth from hearsay is crucial for informed decision-making. Relying on unverified rumors or mudslinging by proxy undermines the democratic process, as it obscures candidates’ true records and intentions. Instead, voters should seek primary sources, scrutinize documented history, and evaluate candidates based on verifiable facts.</p>
      <p>This echoes the wisdom of America’s founders, like Thomas Jefferson, who warned, “The man who never looks into a newspaper is better informed than he who reads them, inasmuch as he who knows nothing is nearer to truth than he whose mind is filled with falsehoods and errors.” Similarly, John Adams emphasized, “Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passion, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.” True journalism, and indeed responsible voting, demands a commitment to truth over sensationalism, ensuring decisions reflect reality rather than distortion.</p>
    
    <h2>Our take</h2>
    <p>After the election, your neighbors are still your neighbors. Don't burn our bridges, and stick to the principles of your faith - seek truth, and don't spread something false if you can avoid it/verify. <br/><br/>
      We still live under the same sky, the same creator, under the same law of the land, no matter how much we don't like hearing something. <br/><br/>Much of this is borne out of FEAR of change. No matter who wins, there are mechanisms for accountability, but it is every citizen's responsiblility to step in when it is needed. That might mean, you run for office yourself one day.</p>

    <p>A cohesive community with that level of respect tends to survive, and fare better in a disaster. You have the men that know each other, saying "I got a chainsaw," "Me too," "ok, let's report to the fire chief or incident commander - have them tell us where it's safe to chop some trees!" That's how a community gets through disaster - serving one another.</p>
